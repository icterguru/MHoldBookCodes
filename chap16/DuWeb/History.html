<P><FONT FACE="Arial Black" SIZE=2>When at the beginning of 1912 Lord Hardinge visited Dhaka as the Chicory of the British Empire, a delegation of Muslims led by Nawab Salimullah drew his attention to the problems caused in East Bengal due to the lack of institutions for higher education. Lord Hardinge agreed that neglect of higher education in the region was one reason for its underdevelopment and assured them that a University would be set up in Dhaka shortly. Accordingly, a commission headed by Robert Nathan drafted a feasibility report that very year. Later, the Calcutta University Commission submitted its own proposals for the establishment and structure of a university at Dhaka in 1917. Whereas the Nathan Commission had proposed direct state control over the proposed university, the Calcutta University Commission recommended that an autonomous institution should be set up. Eventually, the Dhaka University Act 1920 was adopted on 23 March, 1920. After the Governor General had consented to it, the legal basis for setting up an autonomous and residential university in Dhaka was established. On the first day of December of that year, P.G. Hertog, academic Registrar of the University of London, was appointed the first Vice-Chancellor of the University of Dhaka.</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial Black">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT> </P>
<FONT FACE="Arial Black" SIZE=2><P>On the first of July, 1921, the University of Dhaka opened its doors to students. The University was set up in the picturesque part of the city known as Ramna on 600 acres of land which consisted of some buildings abandoned by the province of Assam and East Bengal and other buildings belonging to Dhaka College. Before the university was declared formally open, Vice-Chancellor Hertog was able to draw on some of the newly appointed scholars to take all the necessary measures and to draft appropriate laws so that the university could begin on the right note. Due to his untiring efforts and immense experience, the university operated according to very high standards from the outset.</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial Black">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT> <BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial Black" SIZE=2>The Governor of Bengal was made the ex officio Chancellor of the University of Dhaka. In addition to the Vice-Chancellor who had to work as the chief executive of the institution, the university was to have a court, an executive council an academic council, faculties, and other institutes. Following democratic norms, provisions were made on the basis of the 1920 Act for appointing a vice-chancellor from an elected panel, and for the election of deans of faculties on the basis of votes cast by faculty members. Above all, the importance of autonomy in university affairs was acknowledged at this critical moment of the university's life.</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial Black">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT> </P>
<FONT FACE="Arial Black" SIZE=2><P>When the University of Dhaka began its mission, it had three faculties-Arts, Sciences, and Law. These consisted of 12 departments Sanskrit and Bengali, English, Education, History, Arabic and Islamic Studies, Persian and Urdu, Philosophy, Economics and Politics. Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics, and Law. In the first academic year, the total number of students amounted to 877. Although the university started functioning with only sixty teachers, these included distinguished scholars from all over the world. Among them were such luminaries as Haraprasad Sastri, F.H. Turner, Mohammad Shahidullah, G.H. Langley, Haridas Bhattacharya, W.A. Jenkins, Rameshchandra Majumder, A.F. Rehman, Satyandranath Bose, Naresh Chandra Sengupte, and Ghanchandra Ghosh. Because the university had adopted the tutorial system, students were able to come into close contact with these outstanding teachers. In fact, it can be said that the tutorial system as well as the Honours course were among the contributions made by the University of Dhaka to the cause of higher education in the sub-continent.</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial Black">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT> </P>
<FONT FACE="Arial Black" SIZE=2><P>From the beginning, a distinctive feature of the University of Dhaka was its residential system. All the students of the university were to be managed through residential halls. The three halls established for this purpose were Dhaka Hall, Jagannath Hall, and Muslim Hall.</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial Black">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT> <BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial Black" SIZE=2>In its 1921-1947 phase, the University of Dhaka can claim to have made substantial progress. In this period, two more faculties and eight more departments were opened. The number of students and teachers doubled at this time. Noteworthy successes were achieved in research. 57 research students were awarded Ph.D. and D.Sc. degrees and many learned lectures and symposiums were organized. To meet the residential needs of students, three more halls were built. The campus buzzed with literary and cultural programs and sports events which centered on the different halls and departments.&nbsp;</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial Black">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT> <BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial Black" SIZE=2>But when in 1947 colonial rule ended and India was partitioned, the University of Dhaka had to confront innumerable problems. At that time, Dhaka became the capital of the province of East Pakistan. The University of Dhaka became the only university of the province. This meant that immense pressure was created on the university as the only institution offering higher education in the region. On the other hand, the university was entrusted with the task of supervising the work being done at fifty-five colleges of the province. Moreover, when thirty-five Hindu academics left different departments with the partition of India, a great vacuum was created because of the sudden departure of senior members of the faculty. The provincial government began to meet its needs by taking over many buildings&nbsp; and some parts of the university's property. To make things even worse, the government began to interfere in the workings of the university in all sorts of ways. This process culminated in the ordinance promulagated in 1961 which is now notorious as the black law. This ordinance was opposed bitterly by many within the university because it had replaced the 1920 Act and had curbed the democratic norms and the autonomy of the institution.</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial Black">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT> </P>
<FONT FACE="Arial Black" SIZE=2><P>Nevertheless, the University of Dhaka made some progress in the 1947-71 phase of its existence. During this period new faculties, sixteen new departments, and four institutes were established. A new arts building, a science annex, an administrative building, and five new residential halls and hostels were commissioned at this time. In this phase of the university's history, forty-four research students were awarded Ph.D. and D.Sc. degrees and the number of students and teachers increased substantially. In this chapter of the&nbsp; University of Dhaka's existence, the institution played a glorious role in the country's history by becoming the center of the movement for complete autonomy and democratic rights in East Pakistan. The University of Dhaka spearheaded all movements launched in this period, starting with the Language Movement of 1952, and ending with the movement that took the country to independence in 1971. Indeed, during the War of Liberation of 1971, the University of Dhaka was under siege by the Pakistani army. In this war, fourteen teachers, one officer, twenty-six staff members and a few hundred students were martyred.</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial Black">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT> <BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial Black" SIZE=2>In view of the reaction which had set in against the 1961 Ordinance, the Government of Bangladesh replaced it with a new one called the University of Dhaka Order 1973 As a result, democratic norms and autonomy became features integral to the working of the university once again.</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial Black">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT> </P>
<FONT FACE="Arial Black" SIZE=2><P>After 1971, the university expanded significantly; new programs of research and instruction were introduced in almost every field. There was a manifold increase in the number of teachers and students. Undoubtedly, the number of teachers with advanced degrees and training went up and a qualitative difference in the teaching field could be felt. New research projects are being undertaken every year in this university now. The fruits of these projects can be seen in the six half-yearly English journals and one trimonthly Bengali journal published by six faculties regularly. In addition to them are ten research journals published by individual departments. The scholars of the university have been increasing the pace of their research and have been undertaking projects and bringing out publications outside the institutional framework too. New areas of research have been opened up by them. The University of Dhaka now has eleven institutes for carrying out advanced research. After independence, three new faculties, ten new departments, and three new institutes have been established. With forty departments, seven institutes, fourteen residential halls, eleven centers for advanced research, and one hall for international students, the University of Dhaka is at the moment a huge institution. Recently, the university has adopted an integrated curriculum and is in the process of switching over to a four year Bachelor's program. At present, the University of Dhaka has nearly twenty-eight thousand students and twelve hundred teachers. The University Libraries have a collection of over 5 lac books, periodicals, and newspapers. One hundred and thirty books have been published by the university to date, although in 1972 the number was thirty. In sum, the University of Dhaka is moving successfully ahead in the cultivation of knowledge and in spreading higher education in Bangladesh.</FONT></TD>
